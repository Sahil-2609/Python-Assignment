    "## 1. Explain the key features of python that make it a popular choice for programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Key Features Of Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a popular programming language known for its simplicity and versatility. Here are some key features that make Python a popular choice:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Readability**: Python's syntax is clear and easy to read, which makes it accessible for beginners.\n",
    "- **Versatility**: Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.\n",
    "- **Extensive Libraries**: Python has a rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks that accelerate development.\n",
    "- **Community Support**: A large and active community provides ample resources and support.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example demonstrating Python's readability\n",
    "def greet(name):\n",
    "    return f\"Hello, {name}!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "print(greet(\"World\"))\n",
    "```\n",
    "## 2. Describe the role of predefined keywords in Python and provide examples of how they are used in a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Predefined Keywords in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python uses reserved keywords that cannot be used as identifiers. These keywords have special meanings and are integral to the language's syntax. Examples include `if`, `else`, `def`, and `class`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example of using keywords in Python\n",
    "def check_number(x):\n",
    "    if x > 0:\n",
    "        return \"Positive\"\n",
    "    elif x == 0:\n",
    "        return \"Zero\"\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        return \"Negative\"\n",
    "\n",
    "print(check_number(10))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Compare and contrast mutable and immutable objects in Python with examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "##   Mutable vs Immutable Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mutable Objects**: These can be changed after their creation. Examples include lists and dictionaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Immutable Objects**: These cannot be changed once created. Examples include tuples and strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example of mutable object (list)\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "my_list.append(4)  # The list is modified\n",
    "print(\"Mutable List:\", my_list)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example of immutable object (tuple)\n",
    "my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n",
    "# Uncommenting the next line will raise an error\n",
    "# my_tuple.append(4)\n",
    "print(\"Immutable Tuple:\", my_tuple)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Discuss the different types of operators in Python and provide examples of how they are used.\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Types of Operators in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python includes several types of operators:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Arithmetic Operators**: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `**`, `//`\n",
    "- **Comparison Operators**: `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`\n",
    "- **Logical Operators**: `and`, `or`, `not`\n",
    "- **Assignment Operators**: `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example of different types of operators\n",
    "a = 10\n",
    "b = 5\n",
    "\n",
    "# Arithmetic Operators\n",
    "print(\"Addition:\", a + b)\n",
    "print(\"Exponentiation:\", a ** b)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Comparison Operators\n",
    "print(\"Greater than:\", a > b)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Logical Operators\n",
    "print(\"Logical AND:\", a > 5 and b < 10)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Explain the concept of type casting in Python with examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Type Casting in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Type casting allows converting a variable from one type to another. Common conversions include `int()`, `float()`, `str()`, and `list()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example of type casting\n",
    "x = 10  # Integer\n",
    "y = float(x)  # Convert to float\n",
    "z = str(y)  # Convert to string\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Float:\", y)\n",
    "print(\"String:\", z)\n",

    "## 6. How do conditional statements work in PYthon? Illustrate with examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Conditional Statements in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditional statements are used to execute code based on certain conditions. Python uses `if`, `elif`, and `else` for conditional logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example of conditional statements\n",
    "age = 20\n",
    "\n",
    "if age < 18:\n",
    "    print(\"Minor\")\n",
    "elif age < 65:\n",
    "    print(\"Adult\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"Senior\")\n",

    "## 7. Describe the different types of loops in Python and their uses cases with example.\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Types of Loops in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python supports two primary types of loops:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`for` Loop**: Iterates over a sequence (e.g., list, tuple, string).\n",
    "- **`while` Loop**: Repeats as long as a condition is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example of a for loop\n",
    "print(\"For Loop:\")\n",
    "for i in range(5):\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example of a while loop\n",
    "print(\"While Loop:\")\n",
    "count = 0\n",
    "while count < 5:\n",
    "    print(count)\n",
    "    count += 1\n",
